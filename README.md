## Summary 

Hi!, I'm a first year PhD student at McGill. My project aims to use Python visualization tools for displaying functional connectivity results from MEG and fMRI data.

## Project definition 

### Background

I would like to make use of the different tools we have learned during the course. I'm planning to use MEG and fMRI data from Human Connectomme Project in order to visualize and analyze  functional connectivity measures. I would love to work with other people so if you have similar interests lets get in touch and maybe we could join projects!

### Tools 

Human Connectomme Dataset: As the Open data repository from which I will obtain the data form my BHS project
GitHub: To create a repository compiling all the resources employed for this project.
Python: To explore data visualization and analysis tools to use on multimodal functional connectivity data.
Jupyter notebook: To document the code used to organize, manage and analyze the data. 

### Data 

Data from 10 ?? sample subjects from the Human Connectome Project will be used for this project, including:
Preprocessed high resolution anatomical MR scan
Preprocessed fMRI resting state data (sesion 1)
Preprocessed MEG resting state data


### Deliverables

## Conclusion and acknowledgement

The BHS team hope you will find this template helpful in documenting your project. Developping this template was a group effort, and benefitted from the feedback and ideas of all BHS students over the years.
